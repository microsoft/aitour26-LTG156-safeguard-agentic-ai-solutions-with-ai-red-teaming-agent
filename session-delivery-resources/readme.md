# LTG156: Speaker Guidance

🥇 Thanks for delivering this theater session!!

The session is just 15 minutes long, so please take a moment to read through this document completely.

1. Download the deck and customize it for your stop
1. Watch [this video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70OCsYjOsbs&t=545s) from Model Mondays
1. Read [the speaker notes](./speaker-notes.md) for a transcript

## Demo Delivery

For convenience, we will have the demo segment from the above walkthrough available (without audio) as a file resource you can embed and talk through interactively.

If you choose to create the demo from scratch, please make sure you do so at least a day ahead of time. 

1. Try using the [sample workflow](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects/samples/evaluations/sample_redteam_evaluations.py) or run a scan in the cloud [using this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/run-ai-red-teaming-cloud?view=foundry&tabs=python). This will setup a base scan to which you can add new attack strategies or risk categories later.
1. Or just create a new Foundry project resource - then create a new Red teaming scan via the nextgen portal UI.

## 🚀Get Started

The theater session is just 15 minutes long so your pacing is critical. The table shows a recommended timing split between slides (10 mins) and demos (5 mins). This allows you to cover the core concepts in theory before showing the demo that ties it all together.

### 🕐Timing

| Time        | Description 
--------------|-------------
30 sec | Introductions (Speaker & Topic)
2 min  | Slide 3: Intro To Red Teaming
2 min  | Slide 4: Map-Measure-Mitigate
2 min  | Slide 5: What is Red Teaming Agent?
2 min  | Slide 6: How does it work?
1 min  | Slide 7: New Risk Categories
5 min  | Demo: Setup Scan, Analyze Results
30 sec | Wrap-up (no Q&A)


### 🏋️Preparation

Read the [speaker-notes.md](./speaker-notes.md) file to get a simplified transcript from the video walkthrough that you can customize for your pacing.

### 🖥️ Demos

The demo is a single 4.5-minute segment but the speaker notes shows it broken up into two parts:

1. Execution - setup & run an an AI red teaming agent scan
1. Analysis - explore and explain results from the scan

If you create your own demo runs (e.g., pick your own risk categories or attack strategies) make sure you can hit the same talking points!
